# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yawen!

- I'm currently a M.S. Student in Computational Social Science at UC San Diego
- Iâ€™m interested in applying both sociological and computational methods to address the root causes of disparities in education and develop data-driven solutions that promote equity and improve learning outcomes for all students. 
- Iâ€™m partnering with the Food for Education project to develop a management dashboard tool that integrates regional data sets for analyzing progress in health, economics, and education, aiming to strengthen local capacities and sustain school feeding programs
